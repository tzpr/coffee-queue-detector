# Coffee queue detector
Tired queueing in the coffee machine? Put the **coffee queue detector** to your **Slack channel** and **Jetson Nano** next to your coffee machine. Then just ask the detector if there's queue or not. Or maybe sometimes you would like to hit the queue to have a chat with the people.
